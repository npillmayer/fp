# HTML/CSS Styling

We strive to separate content from presentation. In typesetting, this is
probably an impossible claim, but we'll try anyway. Presentation
is governed with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS uses a box model more
complex than that of the TeX typesetting system and is well described here:

   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Box_model

If you think about it: a typesetter using the HTML/CSS box model is
effectively a browser with output type PDF.
We therefore employ styling of HTML nodes like a web browser does.
A good explanation of styling may be found in

   https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/

We will produce a "styled tree", which associates HTML nodes with CSS
styles. Given the HTML input

    <html><head></head><body>
      <p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
      <p id="world">Hello <b>World</b>!</p>
      <p>This is a test.</p>
    </body>

and a style sheet like this:

    p {
    	margin-bottom: 10pt;
    }
    #world {
    	padding-top: 20pt;
    }

a styling engine wil produce a tree like this (simplified version â€“ the
real data structures are more involved):

CSSOM is the "CSS Object Model", similar to the DOM for HTML.

## Caveats

Browsers are large and complex pieces of software, a fact that implies that
we should seek out where to reduce complexity.
There is not very much open source Go code around for supporting us
in implementing a styling engine, except the great work of
https://godoc.org/github.com/andybalholm/cascadia.
Therefore we will have to compromise
on many features in order to complete this in a realistic time frame.

This package relies on just one non-standard external library: cascadia.
CSS handling is de-coupled by introducing appropriate interfaces
StyleSheet and Rule. Concrete implementations may be found in sub-packages
of package style.

## Status

This is a first draft. It is unstable and the API will change without
notice. Please be patient.
