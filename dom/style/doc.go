Package style provides functionality for CSS styling properties.

Status

This is a very first draft. It is unstable and the API will change without
notice. Please be patient.

Overview

We strive to separate content from presentation. In typesetting, this is
probably an impossible claim, but we'll try anyway. Presentation
is governed with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS uses a box model more
complex than TeX's, which is well described here:

   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Box_model

If you think about it: a typesetter using the HTML/CSS box model is
effectively a browser with output type PDF.
Browsers are large and complex pieces of code, a fact that implies that
we should seek out where to reduce complexity.

A good explanation of styling may be found in

   https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/

CSSOM is the "CSS Object Model", similar to the DOM for HTML.
There is not very much open source Go code around for supporting us
in implementing a styling engine, except the great work of
https://godoc.org/github.com/andybalholm/cascadia.
Therefore we will have to compromise
on many feature in order to complete this in a realistic time frame.
For a reminder of why that is, refer to
this discussion at stackoverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/598841/how-to-get-started-building-a-web-browser.


The styling engine produces a tree data structure, called "styled tree".
Different web browser implementations call it differentyl ("render tree", ...).
We define appropriate interfaces to de-couple the styled tree implmentation
from the styling engine. This may sound odd, as the styled tree is such a
central data structure to the engine. However, we expect to use different
implementations of styled trees, depending on wether it is used for print
or for interactive use.

A concrete default implementations may be found in package dom.styledtree.
